# 🏴‍☠️ Product Scraper 🏴‍☠️

## 📜 Description

This project was created to automatically scrape product data from a website and save it in JSON format. It was developed out of laziness to manually write product objects for my pet project. 😅 Now all product data is automatically collected and processed, saving me a lot of time and effort!

Additionally, it automatically processes images, compresses them, converts them to the WebP format, and provides a new URL. 🖼️🔄
